<h1>
  Paper detector mobile app
</h1>
<p>
  This app was a part of a robotics project where I take images from a mobile phone hanged on a robot, send this images to flask backend where I perform the image prediction using YOLOv8 model and return the bounding boxes coordinates.
  The front end is written in react-native where you run it using ```markdown 
  ```bash npx expo star, scan the qr code and press start to take images.
